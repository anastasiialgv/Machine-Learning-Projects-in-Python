This project demonstrates how to read simple regression data from a text file, split it into training and testing sets, and apply both linear and polynomial regression models. The performance of each model is compared using R² score, and the results are visualized on a graph.

Technologies Used: Python, NumPy Matplotlib, Scikit-learn (LinearRegression, PolynomialFeatures, r2_score, train_test_split)

How It Works:
Reads data from daneXX.txt.
Splits it into training and test datasets.
Fits a linear regression model.
Fits a polynomial regression model (degree 2).
Evaluates each model using R² score.
Visualizes both models and data on a single plot.
